    <p>One of the most important tips for preparing for competitive exams is to start early and create a study plan. Starting early gives you ample time to cover all the topics and revise them thoroughly. A study plan can help you stay organized and on track, and ensure that you cover all the necessary topics before the exam.</p>

    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    
    <p>Time management is crucial when preparing for competitive exams.

    <h2>Practice and Mock Tests</h2>
    
    <p>Practice and mock tests are a crucial part of preparing for competitive exams. They help students become familiar with the format of the exam, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and build their confidence.</p>
